Sort an array based on order defined by another array in O(n) Given two integer arrays, reorder elements of the first array by the order of elements defined by the second array. The elements that are not present in the second array but present in the first array should be appended at the end sorted. The second array can contain some extra elements which are not part of the first array. Input:   first = [5, 8, 9, 3, 5, 7, 1, 3, 4, 9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 4] second = [3, 5, 7, 2]   Output: [3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 8, 9, 9]
